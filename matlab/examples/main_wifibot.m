%% 2D Robot Localization on Real Data
% Goals of this script:
% 
% * apply the UKF for the 2D robot localization example with real data.
% 
% _We assume the reader is already familiar with the considered problem
% described in the tutorial._
% 
% We address the same problem as described in the tutorial on our own data.

%% Initialization
% Start by cleaning the workspace.

clear all;
close all;

%% Model and Data
% Instead of creating data, we load recorded data. We have recorded five
% sequences (sequence 2 and 3 are the more interesting).

% sequence number
n_sequence = 2;
% GPS frequency (Hz)
gps_freq = 2;
% GPS noise standard deviation (m)
gps_noise_std = 0.1;
% load data, where we simulation position measurement
[states, omegas, ys, one_hot_ys, t] = wifibot_load(n_sequence, gps_freq, ...
    gps_noise_std);
odo_noise_std = [0.15; % longitudinal speed 
    0.05;              % transversal shift speed 
    0.15];             % differential odometry 
% total number of timestamps
N = length(states);

%% Filter Design and Initialization
% We embed here the state in $SE(2)$ with left multiplication.

% propagation noise covariance matrix
Q = diag(odo_noise_std.^2);
% measurement noise covariance matrix
R = gps_noise_std.^2 * eye(2);
% initial uncertainty matrix
P0 = zeros(3, 3); 
% The state is not perfectly initialized
P0(1, 1) = (30/180*pi)^2;
% sigma point parameters
alpha = [1e-3, 1e-3, 1e-3];

% define the UKF propagation and measurement functions
f = @localization_f;
h = @localization_h;
phi = @localization_left_phi;
phi_inv = @localization_left_phi_inv;
% get UKF weight parameters
weights = ukf_set_weight(3, 2, alpha);
% compute Cholewski decomposition of Q only once
cholQ = chol(Q);

%%
% We initialize the filter with an initial heading error of 30Â°.

ukf_state = states(1);
% "add" orientation initial error
ukf_state.Rot = ukf_state.Rot * so2_exp(sqrt(P0(1, 1)));
ukf_P = P0;

% set variables for recording estimates along the full trajectory
ukf_states = ukf_state;
ukf_Ps = zeros(N, length(ukf_P), length(ukf_P));
ukf_Ps(1, :, :) = ukf_P;

%% Filtering
% The UKF proceeds as a standard Kalman filter with a for loop.

% measurement iteration number (first measurement is for n == 1)
k = 2;
for n = 2:N
    % propagation
    dt = t(n) - t(n-1);
    Q = diag(odo_noise_std.^2);
    [ukf_state, ukf_P] = ukf_propagation(ukf_state, ukf_P, omegas(n-1), ...
        f, dt, phi, phi_inv, cholQ, weights);
    % update only if a measurement is received
    if one_hot_ys(n) == 1
       [ukf_state, ukf_P] = ukf_update(ukf_state, ukf_P, ys(:, k), ...
           h, phi, R, weights);
        k = k + 1;
    end
    % save estimates
    ukf_states(n) = ukf_state;
    ukf_Ps(n, :, :) = ukf_P;
end

%% Results
% We plot the trajectory, the measurements and the estimated trajectory. We then
% plot the position and orientation error with 95% ($3\sigma$) confident
% interval.

wifibot_results_plot(ukf_states, ukf_Ps, states, dt, ys);

%%
% All results are coherent. This is convincing as the initial heading error is
% relatively high.

%% Conclusion
% This script applies the UKF for localizing a robot on real data. The filter
% works apparently well on this localization problem on real data, with
% moderate initial heading error.
%
% You can now:
%
% * test the UKF on different sequences.
% * address the UKF for the same problem with range and bearing measurements
%   of known landmarks.
% * benchmark the UKF with different retractions and compare the new filters to 
%   both the extended Kalman filter and invariant extended Kalman filter of
%   [BB17] (see the benchmarks section).
